# web3-quant-sandbox

[中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

An offline-first Web3 quantitative research sandbox. It brings market dashboards, opportunity radar, factor mining, data-source monitoring, strategy backtests, risk audits, a simulated trading workstation, strategy DSL checks, and research reports into one local application for learning, teaching, strategy prototyping, and Codex delivery-course demos.

By default, the project runs from bundled samples and repository snapshots. It does not connect to real trading accounts, manage wallets, or place real orders.

> If this project helps you learn Web3 quant research, backtesting engineering, or the Codex course workflow, please consider starring it. If you want to customize strategies, connect data sources, or build your own research panel, fork it and extend it freely.

## Highlights

- **Offline-first**: bundled `data/dashboard/*.json` samples let the core pages run without network access.
- **Public learning academy**: `/academy` combines foundational math, backtesting, K-line, diagnostic analysis, asset-management, and risk-control courses. All 165 unique formulas behind its 169 formula cards have formula-level historical dossiers covering the proposer or systematizer, original context, intellectual roots, derivation, transmission into modern quant practice, and references; formulas without a single inventor are explicitly marked as historically evolved. Search includes people such as Markowitz, Wilder, and Bayes as well as historical context and intellectual roots, while each dossier visualizes the path from earlier ideas to the formula and its quantitative-finance use. Chapter progress is evidence-based rather than manually checked: learners must pass formula-recognition, usage-boundary, and historical-origin questions.
- **Complete research loop**: market overview, opportunity scanning, factor mining, data-source status, strategy backtests, risk review, simulated execution, and research reports.
- **Simulated trading workstation**: `/live-trading` includes a K-line canvas, timeframe switching, trade-plan overlays, dry-run tickets, and evidence panels.
- **Clear safety boundary**: dry-run only records research actions; the project does not submit real exchange orders by default.
- **Extensible strategies and indicators**: examples include MA, MACD, BOLL, RSI, funding-rate strategies, factor mining, and rolling backtests.
- **Course-aligned workspace**: chapters in `docs/v2/` are expected to match runnable commands and code.
- **Full-stack app**: Python local service + React / Ant Design / lightweight-charts frontend.

## Code Architecture

The project uses an integrated local full-stack architecture. `app.py` serves both the built React application and the JSON API, routing requests to the market-research, backtest-audit, factor-mining, and strategy-lab domain modules. By default, data flows read bundled offline samples or local snapshots first; online sources are accessed only when `auto` or `live` mode is explicitly enabled.

## Simulated Trading Workstation

`/live-trading` is the simulated execution entry point for the research workflow. It is not a live trading terminal. The page is organized like a trading workstation:

- **Left intelligence rail**: current pair, reference price, signal conclusion, confidence, risk status, and AI Picks queue.
- **Central K-line canvas**: lightweight-charts candlesticks, volume, MA20, MA60, plus signal-derived entry, stop, and target lines.
- **Timeframe switching**: supports `15m / 1h / 4h / 1D` K-line intervals.
- **Right dry-run ticket**: pair, side, venue, amount, slippage tolerance, latency, and confirmation text; it only creates simulated audit records.
- **Evidence panels**: segmented views for market, signal, risk, ledger, and system assumptions.
- **Light and dark themes**: light mode favors research dashboards; dark mode keeps the trading-terminal feel.

## Data Modes

Dashboard data comes from three source types:

1. `data/dashboard/*.json`: bundled offline samples that work without network access.
2. `data/dashboard/snapshots/`: snapshots captured from online sources.
3. Online APIs: used only when API keys are configured and `DASHBOARD_DATA_MODE=auto` or `DASHBOARD_DATA_MODE=live` is enabled.

Common data commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `py scripts/course.py snapshot` | Fetch dashboard data online and write snapshots |
| `py scripts/course.py sync-fixtures` | Sync full snapshots into bundled samples |
| `py scripts/course.py save-offline-data` | Fetch snapshots and sync offline samples |
| `py scripts/course.py build-fixtures` | Fill samples from snapshots or seed data |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you need local configuration. Without API keys, the app still starts with offline samples.

## CLI Reports

```powershell
python report_cli.py --format summary
python report_cli.py --format json --short 3 --long 7
```

Reports are assembled by `src/research/report.py` from sample data, backtest metrics, risk checks, and execution-boundary notes.

## Frontend Development

In production mode, `app.py` serves `src/web/static/` directly. For frontend development, run Vite alongside the local backend:

```powershell
py app.py
cd src/web
npm run dev
```

Build the frontend separately:

```powershell
cd src/web
npm run build
```

## Verification

During edits, run:

```powershell
py scripts/course.py verify
```

If the `py` launcher is unavailable in the current Windows environment, use the repository virtual environment:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\course.py verify
```

Before finishing repository-wide changes, run:

```powershell
py scripts/course.py check
```

`check` also runs the implementation matrix, asset audit, and courseware check. Every check depends only on files in the public repository. After editing plot scripts, regenerate teaching figures:

```powershell
py scripts/course.py teaching-plots
```

## Who It Is For

- Beginners who want to learn Web3 quant trading with zero capital risk.
- Developers who need local backtesting, risk-audit, and strategy-validation examples.
- Course learners who want to use Codex across research, implementation, verification, and documentation.
- Engineers building private simulated-trading panels, opportunity radar, or research-report pipelines.

## Extension Points

| Goal | Recommended entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Add market data or snapshot sources | `src/dashboard/`, `dashboard_snapshot.py`, `scripts/build_dashboard_fixtures.py` |
| Add backtest strategies | `src/backtest/rolling/strategies/` |
| Add technical indicators | `src/ta/`, `src/backtest/rolling/indicators.py` |
| Extend factor mining | `src/factor_mining/` |
| Adjust simulated trading or risk controls | `src/web/src/pages/trading/LiveTradingPage.tsx`, `src/risk/`, `src/strategy_engine/` |
| Modify web pages | `src/web/src/pages/trading/`, `src/web/src/components/` |
| Update course chapters | `docs/v2/` |

PRs are welcome for generally useful strategies, indicators, data-source adapters, and course fixes.

## Safety Boundaries

- The project does not connect to real exchange accounts or wallets by default.
- `/live-trading` is a simulated trading workstation, not a live trading terminal.
- dry-run only records research actions and does not submit real orders.
- The strategy DSL performs AST allowlist checks, import restrictions, and look-ahead bias checks.
- Online data is for research demos and backtest inputs only. It is not investment advice.
- API keys should be loaded from local `.env` files and must not be committed.
